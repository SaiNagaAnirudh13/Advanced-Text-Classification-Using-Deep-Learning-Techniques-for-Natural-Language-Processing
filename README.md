# Advanced-Text-Classification-Using-Deep-Learning-Techniques-for-Natural-Language-Processing

## Overview
This project implements a **Text Classification** pipeline using **machine learning** techniques in Python. The goal is to preprocess raw text data, extract meaningful features, and train machine learning models to classify text into predefined categories. This project is implemented in a **Jupyter Notebook** and makes use of popular libraries like TensorFlow, Keras, scikit-learn, and others.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing:** 
  - Handles text cleaning (e.g., removal of punctuation, special characters, stopwords).
  - Tokenization of text into meaningful units.
  - Conversion of text into numerical embeddings.
  
- **Feature Extraction:**
  - Embeddings are used to represent text in a machine-readable format.
  - Integration of techniques like TF-IDF or word embeddings for robust feature representation.

- **Model Building:**
  - Implementation of text classification models using **TensorFlow/Keras**.
  - Use of layers such as Dense, Embedding, and Dropout for model architecture.

- **Evaluation Metrics:**
  - Models are evaluated using metrics like **accuracy**, **precision**, **recall**, and **F1-score**.
  - Confusion matrices and visualization techniques are included for in-depth performance analysis.

## Requirements
To run the notebook, you will need the following:
- **Python 3.7+**
- Libraries:
  - `numpy`
  - `pandas`
  - `matplotlib`
  - `seaborn`
  - `scikit-learn`
  - `TensorFlow/Keras`

Install the required libraries with:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn tensorflow
```

## Getting Started
1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-link>
   ```
2. **Navigate to the Directory:**
   ```bash
   cd <repository-folder>
   ```
3. **Run the Jupyter Notebook:**
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook text_classification.ipynb
   ```

4. **Follow the Notebook Steps:**
   - Upload your dataset or use the provided one.
   - Execute the cells step by step for data preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, and evaluation.

## Dataset
- The project requires a labeled dataset for text classification.
- Each entry in the dataset should contain:
  - **Text Data:** The raw text that needs to be classified.
  - **Labels:** The target category for classification.

## Applications
- Spam detection in emails or messages.
- Sentiment analysis of customer reviews.
- Categorization of news articles.
- Intent classification in chatbot systems.

## Results
- Achieves high accuracy and performance on benchmark datasets.
- Model performance is visualized using plots for loss, accuracy, and confusion matrix.
